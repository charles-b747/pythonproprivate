The folder consists of my personal projects for Kodland.

In the "my eco_bot" file you will find a ready and working code for an eco-assistant for Discord! It can generate passwords, send you memes, give you eco-tips and much more! All you have to do is copy the code and insert your bot's token. Then run the code and you're ready to go!
